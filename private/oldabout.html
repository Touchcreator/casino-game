        <h3>Backstory:
            <br>So basically I had seen a bunch of stuff on these gambling sites like Stake and Bloxflip, and I was interested in making my own. Another kid showed me this game named <a href="http://gamble.non-reai.xyz">Gamble Gamble</a> which was made by some other kid. This was basically when I decided to make my idea. If you haven't realized, this game is heavily inspired by <a href="http://gamble.non-reai.xyz">Gamble Gamble</a> and its kind of a ripoff ðŸ’€.
        </h3>
        <h3>Developer: Toto (Touchcreator)<br>
            Heavy Thanks: Tharun(goon)<br>
            Special Thanks: John, Aarman (barely ðŸ’€), Winny (he showed me gamble gamble)<br>
            And thanks to you, for testing out my game!
